# Bill of materials

This folder contains the following files and folders:

* `README.md` - This file.
* `Vagrantfile` - The Vagrant configuration for our virtual private cloud.
* `provision/` - Folder for files used for creating the lab.
* `terraform/` - Starter material of Terraform code for use in the lab.

# Prerequisites

To perform this lab, you must have:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS,
    * FreeBSD,
    * Solaris, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* An active Internet connection (for downloading the required tools in the [set up](#set-up) step, as well as Vagrant base boxes, and the required software packages into the virtual machines; you do not need an Internet connection once you have completed the set up portion of this lab).

> :beginner: :computer: This exercise requires the use of a command line, or "terminal." If you don't know what that means, or if you do but you feel intimidated by that, consider going through [Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s free, online and self-paced *Foundations: Command Line Basics* course](https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/), spending an hour at [Apple's Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/) (for macOS users), [Ubuntu's Command Line for Beginners tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) (for GNU/Linux users) or reviewing [Computer Hope's article, "How to use the Windows command line (DOS)"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) (for Windows users) if you want to get started quickly. You don't need to complete the whole tutorial or article to understand this exercise, but it will dramatically improve your comprehension of this exercise's mechanics. If you want a more thorough but equally gentle introduction to the same material, consider reading (and listening to) [Taming the Terminal](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/blog/taming-the-terminal/).

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools.

* For managing the virtual machines: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 6.1 or newer, sometimes written as *VBox*.
* For automatically configuring virtual machine settings: [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) version 2.2.7 or newer.

Complete the [Introduction to Virtual Machine Management with Vagrant](../introduction-to-virtual-machine-management-with-vagrant/README.md) practice lab before this one if you do not yet have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed or are unfamiliar with how to use them.

Then, bring the virtual machines for the lab online.

**Do this:**

1. Boot the virtual machines needed for the lab:
    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```

Once the virtual machines are running, you can continue to the next step.

# Practice

We'll begin by ensuring you have successfully completed the [set up](#set-up) steps. This process will also introduce the fundamentals that you need to understand to complete the rest of the exercise.
