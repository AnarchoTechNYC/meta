      Log in to your scanner machine with:

          vagrant ssh scanner

      Your scanner is equipped with several helpful utilities such as
      `nmap`, `whois`, `traceroute`, `nc`, and others.

      Once logged in, try scanning these demo hosts:

          scanme.nmap.org
          192.168.88.10

      Good luck!
