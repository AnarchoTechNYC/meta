    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Anarcho-Tech NYC - Hash Cracking ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    You now have a virtual machine with John the Ripper installed.
    John the Ripper (also known as JtR) is a free, fast hash cracking
    utility that can be used to "recover" passwords from their hashed
    equivalents.

    To begin, first log in to the virtual machine and then go to the
    directory in which John the Ripper has been installed:

        vagrant ssh                 # Log in to the virtual machine.
        cd $(dirname $(which john)) # Go to `john`'s own directory.

    Then, use commands such as `john` (or `hashcat`) to try and crack
    the hashes in the `evilcorp-intl.com.shadow.txt` shadow file.

    Please use what you learn here for the betterment of humanity. Only share what
    you know with the people who you believe will do the same. Remember, intention
    is not impact. Kill all Nazis, take down all corporations.

        "You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart.
         That's the thing about conglomerates: they don't have hearts.
         You take them down limb by limb. And as they unravel, their illusion
         of control unravels."
