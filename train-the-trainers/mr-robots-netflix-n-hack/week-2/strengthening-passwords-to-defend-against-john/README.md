# Strengthening Passwords to Defend Against John

In this exercise we will obtain the password of an unsuspecting user by "cracking" the hashed copy of that user's password. Then we will use a password manager to strengthen our own passwords in order to protect ourselves against the same sort of attacks. Our goal is to understand why and how using [password management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) makes having a digital life both safer and easier at the same time.

In other words, you will perform a *[password cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking) attack* and learn how to stop password crackers from cracking your own passwords.

# Objectives

When you complete this exercise, you will have acquired the following capabilities:

* The ability to make and use passwords for your user accounts that are practically invincible against many attackers.
* The ability to replace old passwords with strong new passwords easily, on whatever schedule you want.
* The ability to determine other users's original passwords, if theirs are weak, despite sophisticated attempts to protect them.
* The ability to gauge the approximate relative strength of a password using only "the naked eye."

# Scenario

[![Hacking Tyrell Wellick scene, using the `john` password cracker.](https://web.archive.org/web/20161213025246/https://hackertarget.com/mrrobot/wget-shellshock-john.png)](Mr.%20Robot%20S01E02%20-%20Hacking%20Tyrell%20Wellick.mp4?raw=true)

> Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be tricky but it wasn't. Evil Corp's corporate mail servers? They haven't patched anything since Shellshock. He doesn't even use two-step verification. His password was just his wife's maiden name and Sweden's independence date, `66`. One "six" away from the obvious, but still. This is bad noob practice.

You are Elliot Alderson, ordinary cybersecurity engineer by day, vigilante hacker by night. In order to uncover Evil Corp's next nefarious plot, you must hack into the corporate email account of their Senior Vice President of Technology, Tyrell Wellick. Fortunately for you, Evil Corp's mail servers run a webmail system vulnerable to an exploit called Shellshock, which has enabled you to obtain files listing the usernames and passwords of everyone who uses the system. However, the passwords are obfuscated using a one-way mathematical function called a *hash* (or *digest*).

In order to recover the password, you must "crack" its hashed equivalent, revealing the original. Once cracked, you may impersonate Tyrell Wellick to the Evil Corp mail server by using his username and password to log in as him, thereby gaining access to his emails. Moreover, to make sure that Tyrell Wellick is unable to hack you back, you must set all your online accounts to use "uncrackable" passwords to protect yourself against the very same attack.

# Prerequisites

To participate in this exercise, you must have:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* An active Internet connection (for downloading the required tools in the [set up](#set-up) step; you do not need an Internet connection once you have the tools installed).

> :beginner: :computer: This exercise requires the use of a command line, or "terminal." If you don't know what that means, or if you do but you feel intimidated by that, consider spending an hour at [Codecademy's interactive tutorial, "Learn the Command Line"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (for macOS or GNU/Linux users) or reviewing [Computer Hope's article, "How to use the Windows command line (DOS)"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) (for Windows users) if you want to get started quickly. You don't need to complete the whole tutorial or article to understand this exercise, but it will dramatically improve your comprehension of this exercise's mechanics. If you want a more thorough but equally gentle introduction to the same material, consider reading (and listening to) [Taming the Terminal](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/blog/taming-the-terminal/).

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools.
* For cracking Tyrell's password: [John the Ripper password cracker](http://www.openwall.com/john/), often written as *JtR*
* For managing your own passwords: [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/), for managing your own passwords.

There are pre-built versions of KeePassX for both Windows and macOS available for download from the [KeePassX downloads page](https://www.keepassx.org/downloads). For GNU/Linux users, KeePassX is ordinarily provided as a standard software package directly from your operating system's distributor. Use your system's default package manager to install it.

> :bulb: If you already use a different password manager or prefer to choose one of the many different [recommended password managers](https://prism-break.org/en/all/#password-managers), you can still follow along with the overwhelming majority of this exercise. The fundamental features of all password managers are, generally speaking, equivalent to one another. What matters is that you use one, not necessarily which one you use.

There are several different procedures to install John the Ripper available to you. If you're comfortable doing so, you can follow the above link, download JtR's source code, and install the software configuration of your choosing. (See [Beginner's Guide to Installing from Source](http://moi.vonos.net/linux/beginners-installing-from-source/) if you're not comfortable, but want to try that anyway.) The rest of this section will describe more common approaches to installing John the Ripper in a little more detail.

## JtR installation on Windows

Two pre-built Windows versions of John the Ripper are available. One is an "official" build, compiled by the tool's original developers, and the second is a "community-enhanced" build, which bundles (literally) hundreds of additional features written by volunteers into the application itself. For the purposes of this exercise, it does not matter which version you choose to get, although the community-enhanced version is recommended. To install John the Ripper, take the following steps:

**Do this:**

1. Go to [the John the Ripper homepage](http://www.openwall.com/john/).
1. Download the Windows version of your choice. At the time of this writing, these are:
    * [John the Ripper 1.8.0-jumbo-1 community-enhanced version for Windows](http://www.openwall.com/john/j/john180j1w.zip) (recommended)
    * [John the Ripper 1.7.9 official free version for Windows](http://www.openwall.com/john/h/john179w2.zip)
1. Unzip the file. Usually, this is as simple as right-clicking on it and selecting *Extract All* from the context-menu. (See [the Windows Help "Compress and uncompress files (zip files)" article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files).)
    * This will produce a folder, inside of which is another folder named `run`. Inside *that* folder is a file called `john` (or `john.exe` if your computer is [set to display file extensions](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000573.htm)). That file is the main John the Ripper application. Unlike most Windows applications, this program must be run [using the Windows Command Prompt](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm); you cannot simply double-click it. However, `john.exe` is now successfully "installed."

## JtR installation on macOS

A pre-built macOS version of John the Ripper is available for modern Apple's Macintosh computers, that is, Macs with an Intel processor. (See [About System Information on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203001) to learn how to find out what processor your Mac has.) If you have such a Mac, then to install John the Ripper, take the following steps.

**Do this:**

1. Go to [John the Ripper's macOS community-contributed builds page](http://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/john/contrib/macosx/).
1. Download the latest version available. (As of this writing, that is [`john-1.7.9-jumbo-7-macosx-Intel-2.zip`](http://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/john/contrib/macosx/john-1.7.9-jumbo-7-macosx-Intel-2.zip).)
1. Unzip the file. Usually, this is as simple as double-clicking on it.
    * This will produce a folder, inside of which is another folder named `run`. Inside *that* folder is a file called `john`. That file is the main John the Ripper application. Unlike a classic macOS application, this program must be run [using the Terminal](http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal); you cannot simply double-click it. However, `john` is now successfully "installed."

# Practice

We'll begin by ensuring you have successfully completed the [set up](#set-up) steps. This process will also introduce the fundamentals that you need to understand to complete the rest of the exercise.

## Introduction

Recovering passwords is generally accomplished in one of two ways. The approach we'll be taking in this exercise, *offline hash cracking*, is by far the more common of the two. We say it is "offline" because we do it entirely on our own computer, without needing an active network connection, after already acquiring the "hashed" password(s) through some other means.

> :beginner: If you've never encountered a "hash" in this context before, this exercise might seem complex already. Searching the Internet for "hash" probably reveals more pages about cannabis than computer security at first, but adding "computer" to your searches will get you [many](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/hashing.html), [many](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-crypto-hashes.html), [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) more [relevant results](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hashing.htm). Another tip for beginners, especially if you've found the regular Wikipedia article impenetrable, is to check if there is a "simple" version of the Wikipedia page. In this case, you're in luck: the [Simple Wikipedia article for "Cryptographic hash function"](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) is relatively straightforward by comparison.
> 
> In the end, a "hash" in the context of computer security is simply a value that ("cryptographically") represents some other value. The idea, in theory, is that two different original values will never be represented by the same two ultimate values after they have been "hashed," and that it is infeasible to recover the original value from the hashed value. ([Watch these few minutes from "Crypto 101"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rmCGsCYJF8&t=20m6s) for a further explanation and some pictures depicting this.) In practice, however, weaknesses in cryptographic hash functions (whether by design due to flaws in their algorithm, or by mistakes introduced through their actual implementation) sometimes result in two different values being hashed to the same value. When this happens, the hash function is said to be "cryptographically broken," because if you can hash two different values and get the same resulting value (a situation known as a *hash collision*), then there is little point to the hash from a security perspective in the first place.
> 
> For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume there are no flaws in the hashing algorithm. In reality, this "sanity check" hash value uses a cryptographically broken algorithm called [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1). To learn more about how SHA-1 is broken, and how to construct a *hash collision attack* yourself, read [Boston Key Party 2017 CTF: Prudentialv2](https://github.com/meitar/CTF/blob/master/2017/BKP/cloud/Prudentialv2/README.md).

The alternative to offline hash cracking is *online password guessing*. We say it's "online" because it's as simple as repeatedly attempting to log in to an active, remote system, such as an email service or online banking website. Of course, most websites don't allow visitors to try logging in to an account too many times. After some number of failed guesses, they will usually lock out the account. Besides, it would be unbearably slow to have to reload the login page over and over again after each guess. Therein lies the key concept: speed.

A password can, theoretically, be any sequence of characters at all. In practice, many systems place limits on what they consider valid passwords, or limit the length of the password. For instance, many websites require your password to be "between 4 to 12 characters, and must contain only letters, numbers, or punctuation marks," or something like that. The set of possibilities that a given password might be is called a *search space*. Given infinite time, it would be a simple matter of trying every single possibility until one of your guesses is right. This technique is called a *brute force search*. In practice, however, we never have anything close to infinite time. If it took us, say, two hundred years to find Tyrell Wellick's password, we would be long dead, Evil Corp's nefarious plan will surely have gone unopposed, and we have still not even gotten close to infinite time!

This means, to be successful, we only have two techniques available to us:

* Guess more passwords faster.
* Make smarter guesses sooner.

Guessing more passwords faster is pretty intuitive: the faster we can make guesses, the less time it will take to perform an exhaustive, brute-force search. This is simply a function of what computer you have. The better, faster, stronger, more expensive your computers are, the more guesses you can make per second. Making smarter guesses sooner involves much more subtlety, so that's where we'll be focusing the majority of our time in this lab.

## Sanity check

First, let's make sure you successfully installed John the Ripper (JtR) and that its `john` program is working correctly. We'll do this by giving `john` two files. One file contains a fictional username and hashed password combination. The second file will contain a (correct) "guess" of the un-hashed password. Given these two files, `john` should be able to apply the password guess in the one file to the hashed version of the password in the other file and tell us that the guess is correct.

> :beginner: It's very easy to create a hashed version of a password, or any content, such as an arbitrary file. To make the hash in this sanity check, I used [the `shasum(1)` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum) on a GNU/Linux system:
> 
> ```sh
> $ echo -n "Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd" | shasum --algorithm 1
> ced91977849c44fd009ba437c14c1b74f632fae6  -
> ```
> 
> Similarly, Windows users can use [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) and a utility called the [File Checksum Integrity Verifier](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290).

The file containing the username and hashed password pair is called `sanitycheck.password.txt`. It contains one line that looks like this:

```
fsociety:ced91977849c44fd009ba437c14c1b74f632fae6
```

On the left, at the start of the file, is a username. In this case, that's `fsociety`. Then there is the *field separator* character, a colon (`:`). Finally, there is the *hash value*. That hash is the obfuscated version of the password we need to guess.

The file containing our guesses is called `sanitycheck.wordlist.txt`. It contains four lines and looks like this:

```
randomGuess
alsoWrong
Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd
someotherword
```

Each guess is written on its own line. We call each guess a *word*, even if there are multiple human-language words on a single line. We call the whole file a *wordlist*, or sometimes a *dictionary* (because it is a "list of words," of course).

When we give the wordlist to `john`, what we're doing is asking `john` to hash each of these "words" one at a time and then compare the resulting hash value to the hash value stored in the password file. When `john` finds a word in the wordlist that hashes to the same hash value as the hashed password, it will tell us that it found a match. When we find a matching value, we say we have "*cracked* the hash."

If `john` is working correctly, we can expect that the third word in the wordlist, `Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd`, will result in a match. If that guess were missing (as it is in the `sanitycheck.no-crack.wordlist.txt` file), we would expect to see `john` report its failure to find any matches.

To perform the sanity check, we'll use this command invocation on GNU/Linux or macOS systems:

```sh
./john --wordlist=sanitycheck.wordlist.txt sanitycheck.password.txt
```

Windows users will need to reverse the slash, but otherwise can use the same invocation:

```sh
.\john --wordlist=sanitycheck.wordlist.txt sanitycheck.password.txt
```

Breaking this invocation down:

* The first part, `./john` (or `.\john` on Windows), runs the program `john` in the current directory (notated as `./` on GNU/Linux and macOS and `.\` on Windows). The rest of this walkthrough always uses the GNU/Linux and macOS style, so if you're following along on Windows, just remember to reverse the direction of the slash to mean "current directory."
* The next part, i.e., the first [argument](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shell_command_line_parameters#What_is_a_command_line_argument.3F), is the `--wordlist` option, which tells JtR to read its guesses from the file given by the value (`=`) of the option, in this case the contents of the file `sanitycheck.wordlist.txt`.
* The final argument, `sanitycheck.password.txt`, is the file containing the hashed passwords we want to crack.

Notice that we did not have to tell John the Ripper what hash algorithm to use. In many cases, it's smart enough to figure that out all on its own! This is one of the reasons JtR is considered an easy tool to use. However, if `john` incorrectly detects the hash format, it will never find a match, since different hash algorithms produce different hash values, even for the same input.

Now, let's practice all this.

**Do this:**

1. Download the [`sanitycheck.password.txt`](sanitycheck.password.txt?raw=true) and [`sanitycheck.wordlist.txt`](sanitycheck.wordlist.txt?raw=true) files and save them in or move them to JtR's `run` folder.
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window and use the `cd` command to navigate to John the Ripper's `run` folder.
1. Invoke `john` as shown above to compare each guess in the wordlist file to the hashed value in the password file.

```sh
$ ./john --wordlist=sanitycheck.wordlist.txt sanitycheck.password.txt
Warning: detected hash type "raw-sha1", but the string is also recognized as "raw-sha1-linkedin"
Use the "--format=raw-sha1-linkedin" option to force loading these as that type instead
Warning: detected hash type "raw-sha1", but the string is also recognized as "raw-sha"
Use the "--format=raw-sha" option to force loading these as that type instead
Warning: detected hash type "raw-sha1", but the string is also recognized as "raw-sha1-ng"
Use the "--format=raw-sha1-ng" option to force loading these as that type instead
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw SHA-1 [128/128 SSE2 intrinsics 4x])
Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd (fsociety)
guesses: 1  time: 0:00:00:00 DONE (Tue Mar 14 14:18:13 2017)  c/s: 400  trying: randomGuess - someotherword
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
```

Since we did not tell `john` what hashing algorithm to use, the very first thing the program did was make an educated guess about the hash algorithm that was used to produce the hash value in the password file. Its guess is based on the contents of the hash value itself; the hash's length, the characters it contains, and other details can sometimes be used to deduce the hashing algorithm. In this case, `john`'s educated guess ("Raw SHA-1") happens to be correct, and JtR informs us that it will proceed as though we had invoked it with the `--format=raw-sha1` option.

> :beginner: :bulb: We can quiet these "warnings" by telling `john` to use a specific hash algorithm. We do this by passing the `--format` option and setting the option's value to a specific algorithm's name. You can ask `john` for a list of all the algorithm names it knows about by invoking it with no options. This will print some basic help. Look for the `--format` option in that output to read a list of hash format names `john` recognizes.
> 
> In this example, I'm [using a shell's pipe](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Pipes) (`|`) to send `john`'s help message to [the `grep(1)` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) on a GNU/Linux system so I can focus on just the fifteen lines of text after (`-A 15`) wherever the `--format` option is described:

> Depending on the version and configuration of the John the Ripper software package you installed, your copy of `john` may not recognize all of these hash formats, or it may recognize even more than those shown here. Again, the important takeaway is that you need to tell `john` (or hope `john` correctly guesses) the hash algorithm to use when cracking hashes. If you don't get the hash algorithm right, you will never find a match no matter how many guesses you make.

Following the hash format detection warnings, `john` produces a report about what it was able to accomplish. The relevant output snippet is as follows:

```
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw SHA-1 [128/128 SSE2 intrinsics 4x])
Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd (fsociety)
guesses: 1  time: 0:00:00:00 DONE (Tue Mar 14 14:18:13 2017)  c/s: 400  trying: randomGuess - someotherword
```

Here, `john` informs us that it found one hash in the password file ("`Loaded 1 password hash`"), along with the type of hashing algorithm it suspects (or that we told it) the hash was made with ("`Raw SHA-1`"). On the next line, we see the expected correct guess (`Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd`), which `john` reports as the plain-text, unobfuscated version of the password associated with the user `fsociety`. Finally, we see the number of *successful* guesses made (`guesses: 1`), the amount of time it took (`time:`), the fact that we have in fact finished trying all guesses loaded from the wordlist (`DONE`), and the time of completion (in this example, shown as `(Tue Mar 14 14:18:13 2017)`). Finally, the current range of password candidates being guessed is reported, shown here as "`trying: randomGuess - someotherword`." Indeed, `randomGuess` was our first guess, listed at the start of our wordlist, and `someotherword` was our last one, listed at the wordlist file's end. Notice that these guesses were attempted in order, from top to bottom. That's important because it means we should place "smarter" guesses, the guesses we think are more likely to successfully crack a hash, nearer to the top of our wordlist, in order to help `john` makes smarter guesses sooner.

> :bulb: There is also some [additional information](http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/FAQ.shtml) in the report. For instance, we're also told that, on this run, `john` is using an [Intel processor feature called SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2) in an attempt to work as fast as possible. We also see a speed report, shown as "combinations per second" (`c/s`). This metric measures combinations of username and password candidates attempted against each hashed password per second. In our case, with our four guesses and one raw SHA-1 password hash, on my specific hardware, `john` says it can guess passwords at "four hundred combinations per second," although this metric will differ based on what else my computer is doing at the time, the processing power my computer hardware makes available to `john` in the first place, and even what kind of hash algorithm is used because some hash algorithms take much more work to compute than others. There are many ways to benchmark `john`'s speed, and to tune it, in order to optimize the "guess more passwords faster" technique (look into the `--test` option) but, again, we'll be focusing on "making smarter guesses sooner," instead.

Now that we've seen how `john` works when we make a successful guess, let's see what happens when our guesses fail to find the password. This will also demonstrate JtR's "`pot`" file feature.

**Do this:**

1. Download the [`sanitycheck.no-crack.wordlist.txt`](sanitycheck.no-crack.wordlist.txt?raw=true) file and save it in or move it to JtR's `run` folder.
1. Invoke `john` as shown above again, but use this new wordlist file in place of the other one.
    * Optionally, use the `--format=raw-sha1` option to quiet `john`'s warnings and disable its hash format auto-detection.

This time, the report output differs:

```sh
$ ./john --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=sanitycheck.no-crack.wordlist.txt sanitycheck.password.txt
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw SHA-1 [128/128 SSE2 intrinsics 4x])
No password hashes left to crack (see FAQ)
```

Rather than start a cracking session, `john` simply checks the password file we gave it (same as before, "`Loaded 1 password hash`") but then immediately reports "`No password hashes left to crack (see FAQ)`." This is happening because `john` remembers both this specific password hash file *and* the fact that we have already correctly guessed the password corresponding to the hash inside of it. John the Ripper maintains a list of successfully cracked hashes in a so-called pot. This is literally a file called `john.pot` and it will have appeared in the `run` folder after the previous invocation of `john`. We can open `john`'s `.pot` file with any graphical text editor or have a look at its contents using [the `cat(1)` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cat) on a GNU/Linux or macOS terminal, or [the `type` command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491026.aspx) in a Windows Command Prompt:

```sh
$ cat john.pot
$dynamic_26$ced91977849c44fd009ba437c14c1b74f632fae6:Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd

> :bulb: The format of this line is JtR-specific, but closely resembles the syntax used by the [Modular Crypt Format](https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/modular_crypt_format.html). See the "[Hash string format](#hash-string-format)" section, below, for generally-applicable details, or the `doc/DYNAMIC` file in the official John the Ripper source distribution for more information about "`dynamic`" hash formats in John the Ripper.

If you look closely, you can see both the hashed and plain versions of the password, but John the Ripper's documentation suggests an easier way of viewing this file's contents. Invoking `john` with its `--show` option (instead of its `--wordlist` option) presents a nicer readout:

```sh
$ ./john --show sanitycheck.password.txt
fsociety:Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Remembering previously-cracked hashes is convenient, but gets in the way of our sanity check. So, let's just delete the pot file and try again.

**Do this:**

1. Delete the `john.pot` file in JtR's `run` folder, or move it to the trash. 
1. Re-run the previous command invoking `john` with the intentionally-failing sanity check wordlist.

```sh
$ ./john --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=sanitycheck.no-crack.wordlist.txt sanitycheck.password.txt
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw SHA-1 [128/128 SSE2 intrinsics 4x])
guesses: 0  time: 0:00:00:00 DONE (Tue Mar 14 18:39:29 2017)  c/s: 300  trying: randomGuess - someotherword
```

This report is more like what we were expecting. It's similar to the first report, where we successfully "guessed" the password, but this time it does not display the cracked hash. That's because we simply didn't include that guess in the wordlist we used.

Now that we understand `john`'s basic operation, and we can recognize what a successful and a failed cracking session looks like, we can move on to trying to crack the passwords we obtained off Evil Corp's mail server.

## Crack session preparation

Recall that, [previously](#scenario):

> Evil Corp's mail servers run a webmail system vulnerable to an exploit called Shellshock, which has enabled you to obtain files listing the usernames and passwords of everyone who uses the system.

Since Evil Corp's mail system was powered by a [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)-like server, the two files you plucked off their system during your hack were the files located at `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`. Often, these are just called "the `passwd` and `shadow` files" for short. On Unix-like systems, these two files taken together comprise a local database that provides the system with information about its user accounts and their passwords. Numerous programs query one or both of these files to answer numerous questions, including the all important question, "Is *this* the correct password for *that* user?"

Let's have a look at our copies of both the `passwd` and `shadow` files, which we saved as `evilcorp-intl.com.passwd.txt` and `evilcorp-intl.com.shadow.txt`, respectively. As before, we can use `cat` on a GNU/Linux or macOS terminal or `type` in a Windows Command Prompt to print the file's content. Here's the `passwd` file:

```sh
$ cat evilcorp-intl.com.passwd.txt
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh

aliciaoldham:x:49002:49002:aliciaoldham:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```

Notice that this text is structured, and it's structured the same way `john` expects it to be. At the start of each line is a username, and the values are delimited by colons. In database lingo, we call each line a *record*, and the positions in the record containing values are called *fields*. The fields are demarcated by the *field separater* (the colon, `:`, for this database). This is why the `passwd` file is sometimes also called the `passwd` *database*.

The `shadow` file is structured in the same way. Here is Tyrell Wellick's entry in the `shadow` file:

```
tyrellwellick:$6$ge7W6aVQ$dhJxmLt2qD964d8GXD7Z53EkxxKfe08LVRBNVZ5Xbg.YXXwgIagzJ9bRB.QUcgvOsdrhitXsTf0MbGY7S1sH60:17239:0:99999:7:::
```

Once again, notice the colons acting as field separators. Notice also that the first field is the username, and that this is the same across both files. The second field, however, is different. In the `passwd` file, the second field was always an `x`. In the `shadow` file, the second field is the coveted password hash.

> :beginner: :cinema: In the Mr. Robot episode, Elliot only retrieves one file, `passwd`. He never accesses the `shadow` file, but he is nonetheless able to crack Tyrell's password. This is an error. Since the password hash is located in the `shadow` file, merely obtaining the `passwd` file would have left Elliot without the information he needed to crack any passwords.
> 
> See the [`passwd` versus `shadow` files](#passwd-versus-shadow-files) section below for details, and the "[Technical errors in the Mr. Robot scene](#technical-errors-in-the-mr-robot-scene)" section in the [Discussion](#discussion) for a list of more errors like this.

It's immediately clear that this hash is way more complex than the raw SHA-1 hash we saw earlier. There are two reasons for that. First, it's a different hash algorithm, a more modern one designed to be harder than SHA-1 to crack. "Harder" means that it takes longer to compute a resulting value given some input, and thus slows attackers down. Second, it's been further complicated by a small amount of extra input, called *salt* (yes, from the expression, "salt to taste"). The salt makes *this* hash different from all other hashes that were given the same, original "unsalted" input. Thankfully, none of this need matter much to us, since `john` already knows how to recognize and deal with salted hashes.

> :beginner: For the curious, the salt for this hash is `ge7W6aVQ`. You can read it, plain as day, near the start of the second field in the `shadow` database. See the [Hash string formats](#hash-string-formats) and [Salted versus unsalted hashes](#salted-versus-unsalted-hashes) sections, below, for more details if you're curious.

Now that we know where the hashes actually are, and that they are conveniently enough already in files that match the structure `john` expects, we can just point `john` at them to get cracking, right? Well, almost. Let's do that with what we've got so far and see what happens.

**Do this:**

1. Download the [`evilcorp-intl.com.shadow.txt`](evilcorp-intl.com.shadow.txt?raw=true) file and save it in or move it to JtR's `run` folder.
1. Invoke `john` as shown above again, using the same ol' `sanitycheck.wordlist.txt` wordlist file as before, but use the `shadow` file as the password hash file instead of the "sanity check" one this time.

```sh
$ ./john --wordlist=sanitycheck.wordlist.txt evilcorp-intl.com.shadow.txt
Loaded 21 password hashes with 21 different salts (sha512crypt [64/64])
guesses: 0  time: 0:00:00:00 DONE (Wed Mar 15 19:58:29 2017)  c/s: 48.00  trying: randomGuess - someotherword
```

Unsurprisingly, `john` immedaitely reports failure. Careful readers will also notice that `john` reports it has "`Loaded 21 password hashes`" but notes they have been loaded "`with 21 different salts`." Thanks, `john`.

The reason why we failed is simple: there are only four guesses in our sanity check wordlist, while the number of possible guesses (the search space we need to attack) is in the zillions upon zillions. Clearly, we need to at least make more than four guesses; we need a bigger wordlist. Moreover, we need a *smart* wordlist, not just any list of words.

## Your first crack

To get us started, John the Ripper comes with a wordlist. It's the `password.lst` file located in JtR's `run` folder. Let's have a peek, and try it out.

**Do this:**

1. Open the `password.lst` file in JtR's `run` folder using your favorite text editor. (Graphical text editors like Notepad or TextEdit are both fine.)
1. Read the lines that start with `#!comment:` at the top of the file. They are reprinted here:  
    ```
    #!comment: This list has been compiled by Solar Designer of Openwall Project,
    #!comment: http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/
    #!comment:
    #!comment: This list is based on passwords most commonly seen on a set of Unix
    #!comment: systems in mid-1990's, sorted for decreasing number of occurrences
    #!comment: (that is, more common passwords are listed first).  It has been
    #!comment: revised to also include common website passwords from public lists
    #!comment: of "top N passwords" from major community website compromises that
    #!comment: occurred in 2006 through 2010.
    #!comment:
    #!comment: Last update: 2011/11/20 (3546 entries)
    ```
1. Invoke `john` again, but this time use Solar Designer's wordlist against Evil Corp's `shadow` file. (From here on out, you will need to work out the correct command invocation yourself.)

Depending on the speed of your computer, in a matter of seconds, this will have cracked (at least) one Evil Corp employee's password, revealing the password belonging to the user `chrispollard`. You were able to crack Chris Pollard's password because, despite not being an English word, it was an entry in the wordlist you just used. For that reason, we say that Chris's password was "in a dictionary," even though it was not in "*the* (Mirriam-Webster) dictionary."

**If *your* password is "in a dictionary," then you've just seen how easy it is for anyone else to crack.** This holds true regardless of how complex the password actually is. Remember `Sup3rs3kr3tP@24431w0rd`? You can bet that's in a dictionary now, just by virtue of it being used as an example on this exercise. So, y'know, never use it as your password for anything, ever.

To drive the point home, let's consider what we've just done. Solar Designer's `password.lst` wordlist has 3,546 entries. That means, for each password hash we loaded from the `shadow` file, and there were 21 of them, we made 3,546 guesses. If we do the math, which is 3,546 &times; 21, we can see we made a total of 74,466 guesses. Technically speaking, we produced 74,466 salted SHA-512 Crypt hashes and compared each one to the appropriate hash in the `shadow` file. Not too shabby, especially when you consider the amount of time you saved compared with making 74,466 guesses *by hand*.

Should you so desire, you can now log on to Evil Corp's corporate mail server and read Chris Pollard's emails. Unfortunately, Chris is just a low-level receptionist. We'll have to crack better passwords if we want to stop Evil Corp's nefarious plot. Besides, Chris's password was exceptionally bad. Most of Evil Corp's other employees are holding strong against this wordlist, including Tyrell Wellick. Ideally, we will crack all their passwords, but his is the one we actually need.

## Better wordlists

The wordlist that comes with John the Ripper isn't bad, it's just small. You might think 3,546 entries sounds like a lot, but given the speed with which your computer can make guesses, it's not. Even the spell-check dictionary on your computer has orders of magnitude more words in it than that, and your computer checks every word you type *as you type it* against each of those entries. Surely, there must be "better" wordlists available.

Of course, better wordlists *are* available, and we're going to use them.

While the most obvious characteristic of better wordlists may be that they're simply larger, remember that the larger the wordlist the longer it will take us to finish hashing and comparing each word in it to the hashes we're trying to crack. That's why a good wordlist is also sorted, with the most likely password candidates at the top. This raises the next obvious question: what are the more "likely" candidates? The answer to that increasingly depends on your target. For instance, most monolingual people choose passwords in the one language they speak, so including English words in a wordlist targeted at the account passwords of Portuguese speakers might waste valuable time.

Before we just chuck a huge number of additional words into our wordlist, though, let's get a deeper sense for how the professionals make their wordlists.

**Do this:**

1. Open the `password.lst` wordlist in your text editor again
1. Skim (scroll) through the wordlist to get a sense of its contents.
1. Find Chris Pollard's password in the wordlist.
    * What was the password immediately preceeding it?
    * What was the password immediately following it?
1. Find the first ten passwords in the wordlist. (These were your ten first guesses.) Compare them with the last ten passwords in the wordlist. (These were your ten last guesses.)
    * How many different classes of characters are in the first ten? (A *character class* is a set of characters, like "numbers," "lowercase letters," "uppercase letters," or "special symbols.")
    * How many different classes of characters are in the last ten?

One thing that should be immediately apparent to you is that many words in the wordlist are just plain old English words. This is because, believe it or not, many people take the term "password" literally, believing that their password must be an actual word. Some security-conscious applications have started using the term pass*phrase* in an attempt to better communicate the fact that a "password" can actually be *completely arbitrary*, and does not necessarily need to be an actual, honest-to-goodness human-language dictionary word.

There's more to notice, though. For instance, you may have noticed that numerous "words" in the wordlist are simple patterns. Common patterns include numeric sequences like "`123456`" and strings that correspond to the rows or layouts of keyboards or a phone's keypad, or the finger positions of trained typists, such as "`asdfjkl;`" (called [the *home row* on a US English keyboard](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225064555/http://www.typing-lessons.org/lesson_1.html)). There are also colloquialisms such as "`shazam`," obscenities like "`fuckyou`," and various pronouns (i.e., the names of places, TV shows, celebrities, companies, and so on). A follow-on obsveration we can make from this is that most of the wordlist's words aren't very long, around ten characters or so.

Moreover, notice that fewer words near the top of the wordlist have a mix of character types. Most of those words are either all letters or all numbers. Most of the ones with letters don't even have a mix of upper- and lower-case characters, and even when they do, the capital letter is usually at the very beginning, just as you'd expect them to appear in regular written text. Later on in the wordlist, where mixed character sets begin to appear, there is still a clearly discernible pattern. Words with numbers overwhelmingly use the digits 1 and 2, and they usually appear at the end of the word. Even the symbols, when they appear at all, are predictable. Most of these also follow clear patterns, like keyboard layouts. Finally, there are almost no occurrences of the more esoteric symbols like the [Section sign (`§`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign).

> :bulb: Of course, the above observations are not the only ones you can make about Solar Designer's wordlist. To find some others, you can ask yourself questions about the list, such as, "In what language are the 'real' words?" and "What is the ratio of 'regular' words to special words like specific industry jargon?" The answers to questions like these can often tell you a lot about where a wordlist came from or what kind of users it might be intended to target. Likewise, it helps to put yourself into the mindset of your target when trying to crack their passwords. Questions like "What kind of information is their password intended to secure?" or "What is the purpose of their account?" might help you find or make a smarter wordlist for a specific kind of target, such as corporate employee work accounts, gamer personal accounts, or crack passwords from a specific source such as an enthusiast or hobbyist forum or social network. See the [Characteristics of a good password cracking wordlist](#characteristics-of-a-good-password-cracking-wordlist) section for a further discussion of this subtlety.

All of these observations are going to be helpful to us in making smarter guesses sooner, that is, in making better wordlists. We *could* now begin the process of composing a custom wordlist to target Evil Corp employees specifically, but in all likelihood "Evil Corp employees" are not so different from any other random company's workers. So, instead, let's just see what other wordlist options are already available to us.

**Do this:**

1. Search the Internet for a better wordlist or two (or three).
    * Some people, including JtR's makers, *sell* wordlists. You do *not* need to buy any of these.
    * Hint: Some of the best wordlists are compiled from previous [data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), and in this context the wordlists are called [*password dumps*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819141410/http://www.security-faqs.com/what-is-a-password-dump.html).
1. Use the better wordlists you found against the Evil Corp password hashes.

> :beginner: :bulb: Here are some tips for your cracking session:
> 
> * You can press the `return` or `Enter` key on your keyboard while `john` is working to ask for a status report. This report will show you how long `john` thinks it will take to finish the session. Depending on the size of your chosen wordlist and the speed of your computer, `john` might tell you that you're in for a long wait!
> * If you get impatient during your cracking session, or if you need to stop to turn off your laptop, you can press and hold the Control key and then, before releasing it, press and release the `c` key to interrupt `john` before the session completes on its own. (You might also see this keyboard combination notated as `C-c`, `^C`, or `CTRL+C`.) This will stop `john` and give you back your command prompt. Don't worry, you can pick up exactly where you left off by subsequently invoking `john` with the `--restore` option, like this: `./john --restore`
> * As a hint, for the purposes of this exercise, if you find the right wordlist(s), it should not take you very long to crack at least a couple more hashes, even on commodity hardware from about 2012 or so. If you're getting nowhere and `john` tells you that your session will last for more than a few hours, you should consider trying a different wordlist. Think through what kind of wordlist you should look for, given the nature of the accounts you're trying to crack, or what you know about the Evil Corp employees, themselves.

If you found and used useful wordlists, you will have cracked a couple more hashes by now. Congratulations, you are now a 1337 h4x0r! If you've kept your wits about you, you may notice some relationships between the revealed passwords, the users who chose them, and their user accounts.

**If *your* password has any meaningful relationship to who you are, what you like, what you use your account for, and so on, you can now see how easy it would be for an attacker to get at your personal data just by making slightly more educated guesses about your password.** Notice, especially, that these "slightly more educated guesses" were not about *you*, just about passwords *generally*. Moreover, these passwords may not even be *your* passwords, just *someone's* password *somewhere* else that they once used on a site you may not have even heard of before. Nevertheless, because it was compiled in a dictionary, you were able to use it to crack Evil Corp's employees passwords, anyway.

> :construction: TK-TODO: Just the "basics." Remember: the focus is demonstrating why the answer is *always* "just STFU and use a password manager." That means this section should be optimized for "aha" moments, along the lines of:

>     * This should crack maybe one or two more passwords, again, to provide that "aha" moment for what `--rules` are and do.

>     * Doing this correctly should reveal yet another couple of passwords; have the passwords be Mr. Robot themed but the rules common (adding numbers at the end, 1337 speak, and so on). Importantly, Tyrell's "bad noob" password is crackable with the right wordlist and --rules.
> 1. Optionally, continue cracking more passwords with advanced modes such as `--loopback` and `--markov`; another "aha" moment with regards to the "smarts" of wordlists and why the only "good" passwords are *random* passwords.

# Discussion

## Technical errors in the Mr. Robot scene

1. Elliot only retrieves the `/etc/passwd` file, and is never shown accessing the `/etc/shadow` file. We are left to presume that we simply didn't see him grabbing that file.

> :construction: TK-TODO: Brief walkthrough of the incorrect parts of the Mr. Robot scene and screenshots.

## `passwd` versus `shadow` files

On Unix-like systems, the [`/etc/passwd` file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd#Password_file) and [`/etc/shadow` file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd#Shadow_file) taken together make up a local database of sorts. Numerous programs query one or both of these files to answer questions such as, "What users are permitted to login to this system?" "How long has it been since this user last changed their password?" And, of course, the all important question: "Is this the correct password for that user?"

Some information, such as the user's login name, are stored in both files. Other properties about the user are stored in only one or the other file. For instance, a user's [primary group ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier) and [home folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory) location are stored in the `passwd` file but not the `shadow` file. Conversely, a user's hashed password and the date of their last password change is stored in the `shadow` file but not the `passwd` file.

In a `passwd` file, the seven fields, from left to right, are:
 
1. The account's login username. This is typically what a user would type into the "`Username`" field of a login form.
1. A symbol representing the account's login password. At one time, this field held the user's literal password. Perhaps needless to say, that is no longer standard practice. An `x` means the password is actually stored as a hash in the `shadow` file, instead.
1. The account's ID number. This is how the operating system refers to the account, internally.
1. The account's primary group ID number. This is often used to assign the user to a certain role shared by other users on the system as part of a [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) system.
1. The user's display name. In the example above, every user's display name is identical to their login username. If I were in Tyrell's shoes, I might have updated my display name to read `Tyrell Wellick` instead of `tyrellwellick`, but to each their own.
1. The filesystem location of the account's home folder. In the example above, everyone's home is set to `/nonexistent`. This location (presumably) doesn't exist, which is the point. Setting this value to a non-existent location is the equivalent of setting "no home directory."
1. The command to run by default when (or if) the account logs in to the system interactively (i.e., with a command line). In the example above, a few accounts have this set to `/bin/sh`, but most are set to `/bin/false`. The latter case has the effect of disallowing command line access for that user.

These plain text files are not the only way a system might store this kind of information, but it was one of the first methods designed, is among the simplest, and is often still used. Other places to store equivalent information includes more complex locally-stored databases (often in [Berkeley DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB) file format) or network-accessible directories. On a typical Unix-like system, the [`nsswitch.conf(5)`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/nsswitch.conf) file determines which sources are consulted, and in which order. Other systems use different methods. (If you're on a macOS computer, look into [Apple Open Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Open_Directory) ([`opendirectoryd(8)`](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/opendirectoryd.8.html)), while Windows users could explore the [Security Account Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).)

## Hash string formats

Tyrell Wellick's account password hash value is not *merely* a hash algorithm's output. The raw hash output is there, yes, but it's stored along with some additional metadata that has been prepended as part of a longer *hash string*. The full hash string for Tyrell's password in the `shadow` file is:

```
$6$ge7W6aVQ$dhJxmLt2qD964d8GXD7Z53EkxxKfe08LVRBNVZ5Xbg.YXXwgIagzJ9bRB.QUcgvOsdrhitXsTf0MbGY7S1sH60
```

A hash string, like this one, is composed of three separate parts. They're not really "fields" in the proper sense because there's no formal, universally agreed upon standard way of denoting the parts. The closest thing to a standard is the popular [Modular Crypt Format](https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/modular_crypt_format.html) specification and the more recent [Password Hashing Competition (PHC) String Format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md) specification.

The parts of a hash string are more-or-less delimited by dollar signs (`$`). From left-to-right, those parts are:

1. The *hash prefix* (or *hash identifier*), which is a short alphanumeric string in between dollar signs. In this hash, it's `$6$`, which generally indicates SHA-512 Crypt.
1. Next comes the salt value, which continues until the next dollar sign. In this hash, that's the `ge7W6aVQ` part.
1. The remainder of the field is the hashing algorithm's output, sometimes called the *digest*. This is the value `john` compares to its own output after concatenating the salt value with each of our guesses and performing the computation specified by the hash algorithm.

## Salted versus unsalted hashes

Part of the usefulness of adding salt to a password in order to produce a *salted hash* is that it forces attackers like us to go through this hash cracking process each time we want to crack a different user's password. If a system hashed a user's password without adding any salt, then the hashes for two different accounts that happened to have the same password would be exactly the same. Worse, this would even be true of two user accounts across completely unrelated systems, if those systems happened to use the same hash algorithm.

Without salting hashes, assuming we already cracked one account, we could instantly recognize the password of any other account that used the same password just by reading the hash value. In other words, we would learn the password without having to perform the laborious process of actually computing its hash. That defeats the whole point of hashing in the first place.

Furthermore, many huge, public, free lookup databases of previously-computed (or previously-encountered) hashes and their original inputs exist online. One such popular database is at [CrackStation.net](https://crackstation.net/). These databases of precomputed hashes and their corresponding original inputs are called [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). Some even larger rainbow tables are accessible, for a fee.
